Project Management tool -"Project Priority Matrix"
It is a tool used in project management to systematically evaluate and prioritize projects or activities based on various factors. It helps project managers and their teams make decisions about resource allocation, planning, and project completion.

This matrix usually consists of a table or table that lists options on one axis and metrics on the other axis. Each measure is assigned a weight or importance that reflects its importance in the decision-making process. Plans are then scored against each metric (usually on a numerical scale) to determine their performance or correlation with the model.

By evaluating activities according to a prioritization process, the Priority Matrix allows stakeholders to identify and focus on the activities most relevant to the organization's goals, strategic objectives, limited resources, and other important factors. This will help allocate limited resources to projects with the highest potential for profitability or return on investment, thus ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the project portfolio.



## Features

A simple priority matrix maps three basic, competing priorities: time, cost, and scope. A priority matrix can be useful for narrowing down multiple project or task options , and facilitating decision making

ðŸ’¹ Critical: Tasks or projects that are both urgent and important. These should be given the highest priority and immediate attention.

ðŸ’¹High Priority: Tasks or projects that are important but may not be as urgent. These should be addressed soon after critical tasks are completed.

ðŸ’¹Medium Priority: Tasks or projects that are somewhat urgent but may not be as important. These can be scheduled once critical and high-priority tasks are addressed.

ðŸ’¹Low Priority: Tasks or projects that are neither urgent nor important. These can be deferred or eliminated if necessary
